DESCRIPTION
    This class uses XML::Rabbit to consume Ant build files using a Moose
    object-oriented interface.

ATTRIBUTES

    On top of XML::Rabbit's normal behavior, this class will also coerce
    Path::Class::File objects to the strings expected by
    XML::Rabbit::Role::Document.

  name
    Name of the Ant project.

  filelists
    Array reference of XML::Ant::BuildFile::Project::FileLists.

  targets
    Array reference of target XML::Rabbit::Nodes from the build file.

  properties
    Read-only hash reference to properties set by the build file. This also
    contains the following predefined properties as per the Ant
    documentation:

    os.name
    basedir
    ant.file
    ant.project.name
