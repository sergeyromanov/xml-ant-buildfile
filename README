NAME
    XML::Ant::BuildFile::Project - consume Ant build files

VERSION
    version 0.213

SYNOPSIS
        use XML::Ant::BuildFile::Project;

        my $project = XML::Ant::BuildFile::Project->new( file => 'build.xml' );
        print 'Project name: ', $project->name, "\n";
        print "File lists:\n";
        for my $list_ref (@{$project->file_lists}) {
            print 'id: ', $list_ref->id, "\n";
            print join "\n", @{$list_ref->files};
            print "\n\n";
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This class uses XML::Rabbit to consume Ant build files using a Moose
    object-oriented interface. It is a work in progress and in no way a
    complete implementation of all Ant syntax.

ATTRIBUTES
  file
    On top of XML::Rabbit's normal behavior, this class will also coerce
    Path::Class::File objects to the strings expected by
    XML::Rabbit::Role::Document.

  name
    Name of the Ant project.

  paths
    Hash of XML::Ant::BuildFile::Resource::Paths from the build file. The
    keys are the path "id"s.

  targets
    Hash of XML::Ant::BuildFile::Targets from the build file. The keys are
    the target names.

METHODS
  filelists
    Returns an array of all filelists in the project.

  filelist
    Given an index number returns that "filelist" from the project. You can
    also use negative numbers to count from the end. Returns "undef" if the
    specified "filelist" does not exist.

  map_filelists
    Given a code reference, transforms every "filelist" element into a new
    array.

  filter_filelists
    Given a code reference, returns an array with every "filelist" element
    for which that code returns "true".

  find_filelist
    Given a code reference, returns the first "filelist" for which the code
    returns "true".

  num_filelists
    Returns a count of all "filelist"s in the project.

  path
    Given a list of one or more "id" strings, returns a list of
    XML::Ant::BuildFile::Resource::Paths for "<classpath/>"s and "<path/>"s
    in the project.

  target
    Given a list of target names, return the corresponding
    XML::Ant::BuildFile::Target objects. In scalar context return only the
    last target specified.

  all_targets
    Returns a list of all targets as XML::Ant::BuildFile::Target objects.

  target_names
    Returns a list of the target names from the build file.

  has_target
    Given a target name, returns true or false if the target exists.

  num_targets
    Returns a count of the number of targets in the build file.

  BUILD
    After construction, the app-wide XML::Ant::Properties singleton stores
    any "<property/>" name/value pairs set by the build file, as well as any
    resource string expansions handled by XML::Ant::BuildFile::Resource
    plugins. It also contains the following predefined properties as per the
    Ant documentation:

    os.name
    basedir
    ant.file
    ant.project.name
