DESCRIPTION
    This class uses XML::Rabbit to consume Ant build files using a Moose
    object-oriented interface.

ATTRIBUTES
  file
    On top of XML::Rabbit's normal behavior, this class will also coerce
    Path::Class::File objects to the strings expected by
    XML::Rabbit::Role::Document.

  name
    Name of the Ant project.

  filelists
    Array reference of XML::Ant::BuildFile::Project::FileLists.

  targets
    Hash reference of XML::Ant::BuildFile::Project::Targets from the build
    file. The keys are the target names.

  properties
    Read-only hash reference to properties set by the build file. This also
    contains the following predefined properties as per the Ant
    documentation:

    os.name
    basedir
    ant.file
    ant.project.name

METHODS
  target_names
    Returns a list of the target names from the build file.

  get_target
    Given a target name, return the corresponding
    XML::Ant::BuildFile::Project::Target object.

  has_target
    Given a target name, returns true or false if the target exists.

  num_targets
    Returns a count of the number of targets in the build file.
